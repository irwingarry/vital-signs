#### Description
The intention for the project is to detect anomalies in generated vital signs via Flink.

For now, the goal of the project is to detect arrhythmia from a stream of patients heartbeats.
All heartbeats are picked up through a local Kafka topic.

I might get around to doing other vital signs eventually.
